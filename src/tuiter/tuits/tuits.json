        "tuit": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk remains “highly confident” that his company will land humans on Mars by 2026, saying on Tuesday that it’s an achievable goal about six years from now. If we get lucky, maybe four years,” Musk said, speaking on an award show webcast from Berlin, Germany. We want to send an uncrewed vehicle there in two years. The ambitious 2026 goal matches with what Musk outlined at the International Astronautical Congress in September 2016, when he said that “if things go super well, landing people on Mars might be kind of in the 10-year timeframe. I don’t want to say that’s when it will occur – there’s a huge amount of risk,” Musk said in 2016."
